🌪️ Disaster Response and Relief Operations Simulation (C++)

This project is a Disaster Response and Relief Operations Simulation built in C++, demonstrating the use of stacks, queues, and vectors to manage disaster relief tasks, teams, and supplies in real-time. It provides a simplified but effective model for handling emergencies, allocating resources, and ensuring scalability in crisis management scenarios.

✨ Key Features

Task Management: Add, process, and prioritize tasks across multiple disaster zones.

Relief Team Deployment: Teams are managed using a stack (LIFO) to simulate quick deployment and return.

Supply Distribution: Supplies are managed using a queue (FIFO) for fair and efficient distribution.

Emergency Prioritization: Critical tasks are escalated from zone queues to an emergency stack for immediate response.

Completion Tracking: Logs completed tasks to maintain accountability.

🛠️ Technical Details

Zones: Represented by queues to hold and process tasks.

Stacks & Queues: Used for dynamic team management, supply allocation, and emergency handling.

Algorithms: Efficient task insertion, prioritization, and real-time updates with complexities ranging from O(1) for stack/queue operations to O(log n) for priority-based operations.

Scalability: Designed to manage 10+ zones, 50+ teams, and 100+ tasks simultaneously.

🎯 Purpose

The project showcases Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts applied in a real-world inspired scenario. It emphasizes task prioritization, resource allocation, and emergency handling using classic data structures, making it a great academic and learning project.
